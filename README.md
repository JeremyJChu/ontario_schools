# Discrimination in Ontario Streaming Process
The Ontario school system's academic streaming process is discriminatory. With data, we can show how. Using Ontario's open dataset, we will illustrate the disparity between low-income and non-low-income student performance in academic and applied math. Project is in-progress. Data cleaning has finished. Visualization will be done with Tableau.
